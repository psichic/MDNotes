## About Krita

- Using Mouse
- New from clipboard option ‚úÖ
- Wheel zooms canvas
- Contains lots of brush sets, defaults: All of them are loaded, if it hurts to pick, you can choose from a class(drop down) of presets like Erasures, Paint or Textures. The default is some kind of fineliner - it is easy to lose it in the crowd! üíÅ To find a brush by name, search for it in a little text box placed underneath the brush sets.

- These brushes  would all paint bitmaps, and krita refers to them as layers (paint layers?). The pointer shaped selection tool would not act on these layers, but the move tool(1), which looks like a cross made of four arrows would shift them after they have been selected by one of the *selection tools* (2) listed at the bottom of the tools palette.

- Although painting seems to be the main forte of Krita, paint patches are considered to be second-class citizens.Tools listed at the top of the tools palette create vector artwork which are considered to be Krita's apex items. However the brush tool, which is a paint tool belongs to the top shelf, row 3.
- To sense layers, write some text and then create a paint layer on top (the default). Draw a curve there. Youd be able to move the drawing, not the text. Select the underlying layer (find layer selection controls in the right panel). Now you can move the text, not the curve.
